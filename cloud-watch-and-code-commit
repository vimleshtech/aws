CodePipeline -> Deploye
=====================
1. Code Commit:  github
		- direct upload (this is not recommanded for realtime project)
		- install git on local -> git init , git add , git commit , git push 
2. We should have  IAM user or use existing Admin User Account
		--credentials (1)  -- user -- 
	"AWSCodeCommitFullAccess"
	"AWSCodePipelineFullAccess" 

		---credentials (2) ----
	- github credentials 
3.Service Role (there are multiple service which will communicate of talk with services)
	example
		- EC2 will access S3
		- CodePipeline will access to codebuild and S3
		
 	a. Role 1	
	Service Name: "CodeDeploye"	
	Role Name: PipeLineRole

	b. Role 2
	Service Name: "EC2"  
			EC2 will acces to S3

	Role Name: PipeLineEC2Role
